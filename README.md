# vehicles_licenses

App is here: <a href = "https://shanwilkinson2.shinyapps.io/vehicles_licenses/" target = "_blank">https://shanwilkinson2.shinyapps.io/vehicles_licenses/</a>

## to do
* make it clearer what postcode sector is (e.g. BL1, get a default to stick in)
* add census 2011 populations for a starter until can get best fit mid year estimates
* add in vehicles registered
* Maybe add penalty points?
